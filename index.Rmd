## Overall

* Paper describes guidelines in fMRI, based mainly on task, but most apply to Resting State

* Provides a "checklist" that the authors believe should be used as a criteria for publication

* Acknowledges the information added will lengthen papers, but allow for more reproducible and transparent reporting

* (Had a lot of influential people as primary "editors")

---

## Describe both who the subjects were and who they were not

* How was the population recruited? 
* What were the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
* Who was excluded and <strong>why</strong>
* Demographics table

## Quality control measures should be documented

* Why did you throw out participant 34?

* What do you call a "good" registration?

* How much is too much with respect to motion?

* Probably least standardized within fMRI

---


## Describe both what the subjects were asked to do and what they actually did

* What was the task performed?

* What are the details? 
    * Inter-stimulus interval
    * Were the blocks randomly permuted

* Were there any "mock sessions"

---


## Specify how regions of interest were determined

* A priori knowledge / other literature

* Anatomically - how were the delineated

* Determined by independent data / pilot data not included in analysis

---


## Provide enough detail to reproduce the analysis

* Software used, including version number and any options specified

* Detailed preprocessing steps
    * Were all processed exactly the same way? If not, explain

* Scripts or code is very helpful here, especially if not using standard software 

* Flowcharts?!

## Report statistical tests to support all claims

* Some reports of "seeing" differences based on masked contrasts

* Need tests of appropriate contrasts to make claims
    * Seeing region A in group 1 and not seeing it in group 2 does not mean it's differentially expressed

---

## Always describe and account for the multiple testing problem

* Did you present FDR/FWER/uncorrected p-values
* Authors suggest also presenting (or supplementing) the maps with unthresholded maps for comparison across studies

---

## The cheese stands alone

* Figures and tables should stand on their own

* Very detailed descriptions and captions

* I tend to look at pictures first in a paper (maybe second to abstract)

---

## Give me your brains!

* "The best test of reproducibility is allowing others to directly reproduce the analysis on your own data" - page 410

* Some of this has been happening, but mainly with resting-state fMRI and not as much of task-based.

* Seems like the way the community is going (and should be)

* Overall more is more (but you may have a 20 page supplement)
